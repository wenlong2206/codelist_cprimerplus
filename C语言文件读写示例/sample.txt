Files can be used to store programs, documents, data,
letters, tables, graphics, images, videos, etc., so it
is necessary to be able to create and read/write filesusing programs; 
The process of reading and writing files through a
program is called file redirection.

A file is an area in memory where information is stored,
and all file contents are stored in binary form. Typically,
files are saved in a named permanent storage device, such
as a hard drive, USB flash drive, DVD, etc. C regards files
as a series of consecutive bytes, each byte can be read
separately; C provides two modes for accessing files: text
mode and binary mode.

Text file refers to a file that uses binary encoded characters
to represent text and contains textual content.
Binary files refer to files where binary values represent machine
language, numerical data, images, music encoding, etc., and
contain binary content.

When reading and writing files, the C program will automatically
open three files, which are called standard input, standard
output, and standard error output. By default, standard input is
the normal input device of the system, usually a keyboard, while
standard input provides input for the program and is a file used
by getchar() and scanf(). Standard output and standard error
output are common output devices of the system, usually display
screens; The program usually outputs to standard output, which is
the file used by putchar(), puts(), printf(); The standard error
output provides a logically different place to broadcast error messages.
